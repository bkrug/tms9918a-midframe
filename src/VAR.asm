* >8370->837F GPL status block.
*       >8374       contains the keyboard argument.
*       >8375       returns the key code, or >FF if no key was pressed.
*       >8376       returns the X-value for a joystick (0,4, or >FC).
*       >8377       returns the X-value for a joystick.
*       >8379       (byte) VDP interrupt timer. Incremented every 1/60th second.
*       >837A       (byte) number of sprites allowed in motion
*       >837B       (byte) VDP status byte
*
* >83C0->83DF Interpretter Workspace.
*             A routine at >0900 executes each VDP interrupt and uses this.
*       >83C4       (word) Address of user-defined interrupt
*       >83D6       (word) Screen time-out counter. Decrements every 1/60th second.
*       >83DA       (word) Player number used in some scan routine
*       >83DC       (word) undocumented. Switches between two values.
*       >83DE       (word) undocumented. Out of our control.

* >83E0->83FF GPL workspace registers.
*             It's a workspace. All of it is out of our control,
*             but writing to these addresses (words) in particular breaks our program.
